# private packages

This directory contains the private python packages used in this project,
analogous to the practice described in [this blogpost](https://medium.com/underdog-io-engineering/vendoring-python-dependencies-with-pip-b9eb6078b9c0)

Upgrade using `fab upgrade_teramap` after setting the desired version in `fabfile.py`.

Eventually, this could be replaced by a private pypi server, for example:
